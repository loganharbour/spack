# Settings here are versioned with Spack and are intended to provide
# sensible defaults out of the box. Spack maintainers should edit this
# file to keep it current.
#
# Users can override these settings by editing
# `$SPACK_ROOT/etc/spack/concretizer.yaml`, `~/.spack/concretizer.yaml`,
# or by adding a `concretizer:` section to an environment.

concretizer:
  # Whether to consider installed packages or packages from buildcaches when
  # concretizing specs. If `true`, we'll try to use as many installs/binaries
  # as possible, rather than building. If `false`, we'll always give you a fresh
  # concretization.
  reuse: false

  # If `true`, Spack will consider minimizing builds its *topmost* priority.
  # Note that this can result in weird package configurations. In particular,
  # Spack will disable variants and might downgrade versions to avoid building
  # new packages for an install. By default, Spack respects defaults from
  # packages and preferences *before* minimizing the number of builds.
  #
  # Example for intuition: `cmake` can optionally build without openssl, but
  # it's enabled by default because many builds use that functionality. Using
  # `minimal: true` will build `cmake~openssl` unless the user asks for
  # `cmake+openssl` explicitly.
  minimal: false
